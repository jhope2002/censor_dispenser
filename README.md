Codecademy "Censor Dispenser" Project

This is my second attempt at completing the Censor Dispenser project on Codecademy.  I did my best throughout the first part of the project to maintain the format of each email. To do this, I didn't convert the email to a list, but only replaced words and phrases in the original opened email.  During the last step, this was impossible, so I modified my first function into another that converts the email to a list.
